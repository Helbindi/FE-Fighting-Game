# Fire Emblem Fighting Game
Saw a cool Youtube tutorial by [Chris Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ) using HTML Canvas and Javascript to make a browser fighting game. I tried making my own using [characters and sprites](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/fireemblemthesacredstones/) from the GBA game Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones
